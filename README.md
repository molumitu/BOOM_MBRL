# [NeurIPS2025] Bootstrap Off-policy with World Model (BOOM)

## Notes
Our paper reports the results after 2 million (2M) iterations. The default action repeat is 2, corresponding to 4 million (4M) environmental steps.  


## Quick Start Instructions

```bash
conda create -n boom python=3.9
conda activate boom
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .  # Ensure setup.py exists in the current directory
cd boom
python train.py # Default is dog-run, with an expected score of ~800.
# For Humanoid-bench, you can set task=humanoid_h1-run as an example.
```
